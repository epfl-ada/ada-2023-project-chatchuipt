# Every Season is Beerable

## Abstract

This project aims mainly at studying the beer trends based on seasons. In fact, each individual may tend to consume different
beers based on its mood or feeling influenced by the season. A study of a high variety of beers may helps to see if some beers
have variable success rate accross the year of inversely have a constant consumption rate. After identifying how some specific
types of beers can be consumed at different times of the year, we could dig further those tendencies to see if they also 
varies during the years. This would let us know if the beer success at some time would be ephemere or inversely anchored
in the consumption habits of beer drinkers. This quantitative analysis of the rate of consumption can be complemented 
with a sentimental analysis of the ratings and the comments. It is a good point to see that a beer is more consummed at one time
in the year, but does the rating and the comments about this beer are also more positives ? This would indicate for different 
products if it is only consumed due to its presence or in the opposite, if this beer is really more valuable at one time of 
the year compared to other beers.

## Research Questions

add analysis for diff countries ? mouais --> better to specialize on one kind of countries !!

Is a beer more incline to be consumed at one time of the year ? 

Which characteristics of a beer makes it to be more a spring-beer or a fall-beer ?

Do people consume one type of beer more due to its better taste than usual ? 

Are the rating of the beer and the commentary given for it in adequation to each others ?

Do some beers only follow some one season trend and would then be forgotten in the next years ?

## Proposed additional datasets (if any) 

No additional dataset to provide, complete dataset !

## Methods

Graphs plotting for different kind of beers, evolution accross time, evolution between years by superposition, ...
correlation between senitmental analysis of comments and ratings ?
sentimental analysis of comments in order to grade the comments with a high positivity etc for example with the site :

## Proposed timeline

beers variety accross seasons --> id kind of beers --> compare characteristics --> see tendencies variation accross year 
--> ratings of beers variation accross season also follows trends --> correlation between ratings and sentimental analysis 
of the comments --> beer trends description
